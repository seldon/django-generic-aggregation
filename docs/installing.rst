 Installing django-generic-aggregation
=======================================

First you need to grab a checkout of the code.  There are a couple ways:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    pip install django-generic-aggregation
    
    git clone http://github.com/seldon/django-generic-aggregation.git

If you grabbed the checkout, to install system-wide, use:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ python setup.py install

or put the ``generic_aggregation`` folder on your Python path.
